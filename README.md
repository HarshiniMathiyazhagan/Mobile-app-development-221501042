## **Features**

### **1. User Authentication**  
- Verifies entered usernames and passwords.  
- **Features:**  
  - Error notifications for invalid credentials.  
  - Implements secure session management.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Users can log in with their credentials. Upon successful login, they are redirected to the main interface. Incorrect attempts will display an error alert.

### **2. Dynamic Font Settings**  
- Provides options to customize font styles and sizes.  
- **Features:**  
  - Offers predefined font options.  
  - Allows users to adjust font sizes dynamically.  
  - Real-time preview of changes.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Navigate to "Font Settings" in the app menu to customize the font style and size.

### **3. Built-in Calculator**  
- A simple calculator for quick arithmetic operations.  
- **Features:**  
  - Performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
  - Clean and intuitive user interface.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Open the calculator from the app menu, input values, and select the desired operation.

### **4. Database Integration**  
- Provides seamless database connectivity for your app.  
- **Features:**  
  - Supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.  
  - Allows configuration of server details, database name, and credentials.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Set up connection parameters and integrate the app with the database for data storage and retrieval.

### **5. Credentials Validation**  
- Enhances user account security during registration and login.  
- **Features:**  
  - Email verification by sending confirmation links.  
  - Optional Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for extra protection.  
  - Password strength meter to ensure secure passwords.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Users must verify their email to complete registration. Enable 2FA in the settings for added security.

### **6. Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

#### **Speech-to-Text (STT)**  
- Converts spoken words into text in real time, enabling voice commands and transcription.  
- **Features:**  
  - Instant transcription for live applications.  
  - Multi-language support for broader usability.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Speak into the microphone, and the app will transcribe the speech into text.  

#### **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
- Converts written text into audible speech, providing an auditory experience of written content.  
- **Features:**  
  - Realistic and natural-sounding voice output.  
  - Ideal for accessibility and hands-free interaction.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Enter text into the app, and it will read the content aloud.  

### **7. Traffic Sign Recognition**  
- Leverages machine learning to identify traffic signs.  
- **Features:**  
  - Integrates TensorFlow Lite for efficient detection.  
  - Provides real-time recognition from captured images.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Use the camera to capture a traffic sign, and the app will display its details.

### **8. Face Detection**  
- Detects faces in images or live camera feeds.  
- **Features:**  
  - Uses MediaPipe for accurate detection.  
  - Can be extended for AR applications or emotion analysis.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Access the face detection feature, point the camera, and view real-time results.

### **9. Barcode Reader**  
- A fast and reliable barcode scanning tool.  
- **Features:**  
  - Decodes multiple barcode formats, including QR codes.  
  - Functions offline for seamless operation.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Align a barcode within the scan area to retrieve encoded data.
